SUMMARY:
Toronto Taxi Fare Finder is a web application that estimates the taxi fare
from one point to another (based on Toronto taxi rates and the distance 
travelled).

It consists of:
1) Input fields where the user enters their taxi route origin and destination.
2) A button the user clicks to show their estimated taxi fare. 
3) A map (via Google Maps API) that shows the taxi route from the origin to the
   destination.
4) An output field that shows the estimated taxi fare and route distance (or an 
   error message if a valid route origin or destination has not been provided).
5) A fare calculator that computes an estimate of the taxi route fare based on 
   the route distance.

This application makes use of the jQuery library and Google Maps API.
